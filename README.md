# Supervised learning
---
Supervised learning without machine learning libraries.<br>
The purpose of this project is to learn about the concepts of supervised learning algorithms.<br>
<br>
1. Binary linear classification<br>
2. Logistic classification<br>
3. One vs Rest<br>
4. Multinomial logistic classification<br>
5. Non-linear multi nomial classification (multi-layer perceptron)<br>
